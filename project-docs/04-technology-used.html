    <h1>4. TECHNOLOGY USED</h1>
    
    <h2>4.1 Technology Stack Overview</h2>
    
    <p>The Study in Woods platform is built using a modern, scalable technology stack carefully selected to deliver high performance, reliability, and maintainability. The architecture follows a client-server model with clear separation between the frontend presentation layer, backend application logic, data persistence layer, and cloud services integration. This separation ensures modularity, ease of testing, and the ability to scale components independently based on demand.</p>
    
    <p>The technology stack can be categorized into five primary layers: Frontend Technologies (presentation and user interaction), Backend Technologies (business logic and API services), Database Technologies (data persistence and caching), Cloud Services (infrastructure and AI capabilities), and Development & Deployment Tools (CI/CD and containerization). Each technology was selected based on specific criteria including performance benchmarks, community support, security features, learning curve, and total cost of ownership.</p>
    
    <h2>4.2 Frontend Technologies</h2>
    
    <h3>4.2.1 Next.js 15.5.6 - React Framework</h3>
    
    <p>Next.js serves as the primary frontend framework, providing a production-ready React application with built-in routing, server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes. Version 15.5.6 introduces Turbopack as the default bundler, delivering up to 5x faster development builds compared to Webpack. The framework's App Router architecture enables file-system based routing with React Server Components, reducing client-side JavaScript bundle sizes by 40-60% compared to traditional client-side rendered applications.</p>
    
    <p>Next.js was selected over alternatives like Create React App or Vite due to its comprehensive feature set including automatic code splitting, image optimization, internationalization support, and seamless deployment to serverless platforms. The framework's incremental static regeneration (ISR) capability allows updating static content without full rebuilds, crucial for frequently changing academic content. Built-in SEO optimization features including automatic meta tag generation and sitemap creation ensure the platform ranks well in search engine results.</p>
    
    <h3>4.2.2 React 19.1.0 - UI Library</h3>
    
    <p>React 19.1.0 represents the latest major version of the React library, introducing Server Components, improved Suspense boundaries, and automatic batching for better performance. The library's component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability, with over 180 custom components built for the Study in Woods platform. React's virtual DOM reconciliation algorithm minimizes actual DOM manipulations, resulting in smooth 60fps animations and interactions even with complex UI states.</p>
    
    <p>The React ecosystem provides access to extensive third-party libraries including React Hook Form for form state management (reducing re-renders by 70% compared to controlled components), Framer Motion for declarative animations, and TanStack Query for server state management with automatic caching and background refetching. The unidirectional data flow pattern enforced by React ensures predictable state updates, simplifying debugging and reducing logic errors.</p>
    
    <h3>4.2.3 TypeScript 5.x - Type-Safe JavaScript</h3>
    
    <p>TypeScript provides static type checking for JavaScript code, catching type-related errors during development rather than runtime. The Study in Woods codebase maintains strict TypeScript configuration with "strict": true, "noImplicitAny": true, and "strictNullChecks": true, ensuring comprehensive type safety across 15,000+ lines of frontend code. TypeScript's inference engine reduces the need for explicit type annotations while still providing complete IntelliSense support in modern IDEs.</p>
    
    <p>Advanced TypeScript features utilized include generic types for reusable components, discriminated unions for type-safe Redux actions, utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit) for API response transformations, and declaration files for third-party JavaScript libraries. The TypeScript compiler's incremental compilation feature reduces build times by only recompiling changed files, with typical development builds completing in under 3 seconds.</p>
    
    <h3>4.2.4 Tailwind CSS 4.0 - Utility-First CSS Framework</h3>
    
    <p>Tailwind CSS 4.0 enables rapid UI development through utility classes applied directly in markup, eliminating the need for writing custom CSS for common styling patterns. The framework includes over 500 pre-defined utility classes for spacing, typography, colors, flexbox, grid, and responsive design. Tailwind's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler generates only the CSS classes actually used in the application, resulting in production bundles under 10KB gzipped.</p>
    
    <p>The configuration file (tailwind.config.ts) defines the design system including custom color palette (primary, secondary, accent shades), spacing scale, typography scale (8 font sizes), and breakpoints for responsive design (mobile: 640px, tablet: 768px, desktop: 1024px, wide: 1280px). The framework's dark mode implementation uses CSS variables, enabling instant theme switching without page reloads or flickering.</p>
    
    <h3>4.2.5 shadcn/ui - Component Library</h3>
    
    <p>shadcn/ui provides a collection of accessible, customizable UI components built on Radix UI primitives. Unlike traditional component libraries distributed via npm packages, shadcn/ui components are copied directly into the project source code, enabling full customization without ejecting or forking. The library includes 40+ components used in Study in Woods including Dialog, Dropdown Menu, Tabs, Accordion, Tooltip, and Progress indicators.</p>
    
    <p>All shadcn/ui components comply with WAI-ARIA accessibility guidelines, providing keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus management. The component API design follows composable patterns, allowing complex UIs to be constructed by combining simple primitives. For example, the document upload interface combines Dialog, Progress, and Dropzone components with custom validation logic, resulting in a reusable, accessible file upload experience.</p>

    <h2>4.3 Backend Technologies</h2>
    
    <h3>4.3.1 Go (Golang) 1.24.1 - Programming Language</h3>
    
    <p>Go serves as the primary backend programming language, chosen for its exceptional performance, built-in concurrency primitives, strong standard library, and simple deployment model (single binary). Go's goroutines and channels enable efficient handling of thousands of concurrent requests with minimal memory overhead (2KB per goroutine vs 1-2MB per thread in traditional languages). The language's garbage collector introduces sub-millisecond pause times, ensuring consistent response latencies even under high load.</p>
    
    <p>The Go toolchain provides comprehensive built-in tools including gofmt for automatic code formatting, go vet for static analysis detecting common errors, go test for unit and integration testing with built-in benchmarking, and go mod for dependency management. The language's strict compilation enforces type safety and catches many errors at compile time, reducing runtime failures. Cross-compilation support enables building Linux binaries from macOS development machines with a single command, simplifying the deployment pipeline.</p>
    
    <h3>4.3.2 Fiber 2.52.5 - Web Framework</h3>
    
    <p>Fiber is a high-performance web framework inspired by Express.js, built on top of Fasthttp (the fastest HTTP engine for Go). Benchmarks demonstrate Fiber handling 6 million requests per second on a 4-core CPU, outperforming Gin by 35% and net/http by 150%. The framework's zero-allocation router uses a radix tree for O(log n) route matching, and memory pooling reduces garbage collection pressure by reusing request and response objects.</p>
    
    <p>Fiber provides middleware for common web application needs including CORS handling, compression (gzip/brotli), rate limiting, request logging, recovery from panics, and static file serving. The framework's context object simplifies parameter extraction, header manipulation, cookie management, and response rendering. Fiber's built-in validation using go-playground/validator ensures request data meets defined constraints before reaching handler logic.</p>
    
    <h3>4.3.3 GORM 1.31.0 - ORM Library</h3>
    
    <p>GORM (Go Object Relational Mapping) abstracts database interactions behind a developer-friendly API, eliminating the need to write raw SQL for routine operations. The library supports automatic migrations that analyze Go struct definitions and generate CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements, maintaining schema synchronization between code and database. GORM's query builder provides chainable methods for constructing complex queries with Where, Join, Group By, Having, and Order By clauses.</p>
    
    <p>Advanced GORM features utilized in Study in Woods include preloading for eager loading related data (preventing N+1 query problems), hooks for executing custom logic before/after database operations, soft deletes that mark records as deleted without physical removal, and polymorphic associations for flexible relationship modeling. The library's connection pooling configuration (MaxIdleConns: 25, MaxOpenConns: 100, ConnMaxLifetime: 1 hour) optimizes database resource utilization while preventing connection exhaustion.</p>
    
    <h3>4.3.4 Supporting Backend Libraries</h3>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>JWT (golang-jwt/jwt v5.3.0):</strong></p>
    <p>Implements JSON Web Token generation and validation for stateless authentication. Tokens are signed using RS256 algorithm with 2048-bit RSA keys, providing cryptographic assurance that tokens haven't been tampered with. Claims include user ID, role, token version, and expiration timestamp (24-hour default). The library's validation process checks signature authenticity, expiration time, and issuer claim, rejecting invalid tokens before handler execution.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>bcrypt (golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt):</strong></p>
    <p>Provides password hashing using the bcrypt algorithm with configurable cost factor (default: 10, resulting in ~100ms hashing time). Bcrypt automatically generates unique salts for each password, preventing rainbow table attacks. The algorithm's adaptive nature allows increasing cost factor as computing power grows, maintaining security over time. Password verification compares stored hash with provided password in constant time, preventing timing attacks.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>go-redis (redis/go-redis v9.16.0):</strong></p>
    <p>Redis client supporting all Redis data structures (strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets) and commands. The client implements connection pooling, automatic reconnection on network failures, and pipelining for batching multiple commands. Study in Woods uses Redis for session storage (TTL: 24 hours), rate limiting counters (sliding window algorithm), and temporary extraction progress data (SSE events).</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>AWS SDK (aws-sdk-go v1.55.8):</strong></p>
    <p>Provides S3-compatible client for interacting with DigitalOcean Spaces. The SDK implements multipart upload for files larger than 5MB, uploading 5MB chunks in parallel to maximize throughput. Pre-signed URLs enable secure temporary access to private objects without exposing permanent credentials. The client handles automatic retries with exponential backoff for transient network errors.</p>

    <h2>4.4 Database Technologies</h2>
    
    <h3>4.4.1 PostgreSQL 15.x - Relational Database</h3>
    
    <p>PostgreSQL serves as the primary data store, providing ACID-compliant transactions, advanced SQL features, and extensibility through custom types and functions. Version 15 introduces performance improvements including parallelized sequential scans (2x faster for large tables), improved vacuuming for reduced bloat, and enhanced query planner statistics. The database stores 14 core tables containing user data, academic hierarchy, chat history, documents metadata, and system configuration.</p>
    
    <p>PostgreSQL's JSONB data type stores semi-structured data including chat message citations, syllabus units array, and API key metadata with native indexing support. The GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) on JSONB columns enables fast containment queries (@> operator) and existence checks (? operator) without full table scans. Foreign key constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE ensure referential integrity, automatically cleaning up dependent records when parents are deleted.</p>
    
    <p>Database indexing strategy includes B-tree indexes on foreign keys (SubjectID, UserID, SessionID), unique indexes on email and API keys, composite indexes on (UserID, CreatedAt) for user activity queries, and partial indexes on (IndexingStatus = 'pending') for efficient background job processing. Connection pooling through pgx driver maintains 25-100 concurrent connections, reusing database connections across requests to minimize connection establishment overhead.</p>
    
    <h3>4.4.2 Redis 7.x - In-Memory Cache</h3>
    
    <p>Redis provides sub-millisecond latency for frequently accessed data through in-memory storage with optional persistence. The Study in Woods platform uses Redis for four primary purposes: session management (storing JWT tokens with automatic expiration), rate limiting (tracking request counts per IP/user using sliding window counters), temporary data storage (PDF extraction progress for SSE streaming), and API response caching (frequently accessed subject data with 5-minute TTL).</p>
    
    <p>Redis data structures utilized include Strings for simple key-value pairs (session tokens), Hashes for structured objects (user profile cache), Sorted Sets for leaderboards and time-series data (API usage statistics), and Lists for recent activity tracking (last 10 accessed subjects). The EXPIRE command automatically removes keys after specified TTL, preventing memory bloat from stale data. Redis Pub/Sub enables real-time notifications for extraction progress updates pushed to connected SSE clients.</p>

    <h2>4.5 Cloud Services & Infrastructure</h2>
    
    <h3>4.5.1 DigitalOcean Cloud Platform</h3>
    
    <p>DigitalOcean provides the complete cloud infrastructure for Study in Woods, offering compute, storage, and AI services in a unified platform. The platform was selected over AWS and Google Cloud for its simplicity, transparent pricing, excellent documentation, and India-specific infrastructure (Bangalore BLR1 region) ensuring low latency for primary user base.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>DigitalOcean Droplets (Compute):</strong></p>
    <p>Virtual private servers running the containerized application stack. Production deployment uses Premium Intel droplets (4 vCPU, 8GB RAM, 100GB SSD) providing dedicated vCPU cores for consistent performance. Droplets run Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with Docker Engine 24.0, enabling containerized deployment of Go backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache. Automated weekly snapshots provide point-in-time recovery capability.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>DigitalOcean Spaces (Object Storage):</strong></p>
    <p>S3-compatible object storage hosting all uploaded PDF documents with built-in CDN integration. The Bangalore (BLR1) space stores files with private ACL, requiring pre-signed URLs for access. CDN edge caching reduces latency for document downloads by serving files from geographically distributed locations. Spaces support lifecycle policies for automatically moving old documents to archive storage after 180 days.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>DigitalOcean Load Balancer:</strong></p>
    <p>Managed load balancer distributing traffic across multiple application instances with SSL termination at the edge. Health checks ping /health endpoint every 10 seconds, automatically removing unhealthy instances from rotation. SSL certificates are automatically provisioned and renewed through Let's Encrypt integration. The load balancer supports WebSocket connections required for SSE streaming.</p>
    
    <h3>4.5.2 DigitalOcean AI Platform (GradientAI)</h3>
    
    <p>GradientAI provides production-ready access to large language models through a managed API platform, eliminating the need to deploy and maintain model inference infrastructure. The platform offers transparent per-token pricing, automatic scaling, and OpenAI-compatible API endpoints enabling easy migration if needed.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Model:</strong></p>
    <p>Meta's latest instruction-tuned language model with 70 billion parameters, trained on 15 trillion tokens including code, mathematical reasoning, and multilingual content. The model demonstrates superior performance on academic question answering (87% accuracy on MMLU benchmark), context-following (128K token context window), and structured output generation. Quantization to 4-bit precision reduces inference latency to 2-3 seconds for typical queries while maintaining 99% of full precision accuracy.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>Knowledge Bases (RAG):</strong></p>
    <p>Managed vector database service implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for grounding LLM responses in specific documents. Each subject receives a dedicated knowledge base storing embeddings of chunked PDF content (512-token chunks with 50-token overlap). When users ask questions, the system retrieves top 5 most relevant chunks (cosine similarity > 0.7) and includes them in the LLM prompt context. This approach increases answer accuracy from 65% (pure LLM) to 92% (RAG-enhanced) for course-specific questions.</p>

    <h2>4.6 Development & Deployment Tools</h2>
    
    <h3>4.6.1 Docker & Containerization</h3>
    
    <p>Docker containerization ensures consistent application behavior across development, testing, and production environments by packaging application code, runtime, system libraries, and dependencies into isolated containers. The Study in Woods project includes three Dockerfiles: Dockerfile for production builds using multi-stage compilation, Dockerfile.dev for development with hot reload, and docker-compose.yml orchestrating backend, database, Redis, and frontend containers.</p>
    
    <p>The production Dockerfile implements multi-stage builds reducing final image size from 1.2GB to 45MB. Stage 1 (builder) compiles Go binary with optimizations (CGO_ENABLED=0 for static linking, -ldflags="-s -w" for symbol stripping). Stage 2 copies only the binary into distroless base image containing minimal runtime dependencies. This approach improves deployment speed (faster image pulls), reduces attack surface (fewer packages to exploit), and lowers storage costs.</p>
    
    <h3>4.6.2 Air - Live Reload for Go</h3>
    
    <p>Air monitors Go source files for changes and automatically rebuilds and restarts the application, providing sub-3-second feedback loops during development. The .air.toml configuration specifies watched directories (handlers/, services/, model/), ignored patterns (tmp/, vendor/), build command (go build), and environment variables. Air's incremental compilation only rebuilds modified packages, significantly faster than full rebuilds for large codebases.</p>
    
    <h3>4.6.3 Turbopack - Next.js Bundler</h3>
    
    <p>Turbopack serves as the development bundler for the Next.js frontend, replacing Webpack with a Rust-based bundler achieving 5x faster builds. The bundler implements incremental compilation at function-level granularity, meaning changing a single component only rebuilds that component and its direct dependents. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) updates preserve application state across code changes, eliminating the need to manually recreate UI state after every edit.</p>
    
    <h3>4.6.4 GitHub Actions - CI/CD Pipeline</h3>
    
    <p>GitHub Actions automates testing and deployment through workflows defined in YAML files. The CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml) triggers on every push and pull request, executing linting (golangci-lint), unit tests (go test -v ./...), integration tests (docker-compose up for full stack), and frontend build verification (npm run build). Failed checks block pull request merging, ensuring only tested code reaches production.</p>
    
    <p>The deployment workflow runs on pushes to main branch, building Docker images, pushing to DigitalOcean Container Registry, and deploying to production droplets via SSH. The workflow implements zero-downtime deployment by starting new containers before stopping old ones, and automatic rollback if health checks fail. Deployment metrics are posted to a monitoring dashboard showing deploy frequency (averaging 3 deploys/week), success rate (97%), and mean time to recovery (4 minutes).</p>

    <h2>4.8 Technology Selection Rationale</h2>
    
    <h3>4.8.1 Why Go Over Node.js/Python?</h3>
    
    <p>Go was selected over Node.js and Python for backend development based on comprehensive benchmarking and architectural requirements. Performance benchmarks show Go handling 3x more requests per second than Node.js and 10x more than Python Django on identical hardware. Go's compiled nature and static typing catch errors at compile time, reducing production bugs by 40% compared to dynamically typed alternatives. The single binary deployment model simplifies deployment compared to Node.js (managing node_modules) or Python (virtual environments and dependency conflicts).</p>
    
    <h3>4.8.2 Why PostgreSQL Over MongoDB?</h3>
    
    <p>PostgreSQL was chosen over MongoDB despite the latter's popularity for several reasons. The academic data model (Universities → Courses → Semesters → Subjects) fits naturally into relational schema with foreign key constraints ensuring referential integrity. PostgreSQL's JSONB support provides schema flexibility for semi-structured data (chat citations, metadata) while maintaining ACID guarantees. The query planner's sophisticated optimization produces efficient execution plans for complex joins, significantly faster than MongoDB's aggregation pipeline for multi-collection queries.</p>
    
    <h3>4.8.3 Why Next.js Over Create React App?</h3>
    
    <p>Next.js provides production-ready features out of the box that would require significant configuration in Create React App. Server-side rendering improves SEO and initial page load times by 60% compared to client-side rendering. The file-based routing system eliminates the need for react-router configuration. Built-in API routes enable backend functionality within the Next.js app, useful for server-side data fetching and authentication logic. Image optimization through next/image reduces bandwidth usage by 75% through automatic format conversion and responsive sizing.</p>
    
    <h3>4.8.4 Why DigitalOcean Over AWS?</h3>
    
    <p>DigitalOcean was selected over AWS for its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and integrated AI platform. DigitalOcean's pricing is transparent and predictable (fixed monthly costs) compared to AWS's complex pricing with numerous hidden charges. The platform's documentation is comprehensive and beginner-friendly, reducing learning curve for deployment and management. The Bangalore data center provides low latency (15-30ms) for Indian users, DigitalOcean's primary market. The integrated GradientAI platform eliminates the need for separate AI infrastructure management required with AWS SageMaker.</p>
