Uploaded files must appear in a list showing filename, size, upload date, and status (Processing, Indexed, Failed) with appropriate icons.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>UI-4: Chat Interface</strong></p>
    <p>The chat interface shall display a conversation view with distinct visual styling for user messages (right-aligned, blue background) and AI responses (left-aligned, gray background). The interface must include a text input area with send button, session selector dropdown, and new session button. AI responses must support markdown rendering including code blocks, lists, and emphasis.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>UI-5: Admin Interface</strong></p>
    <p>The admin panel shall provide tabbed sections for Users, Analytics, Settings, and Audit Logs. User management must display a searchable table with columns for Name, Email, Role, Status, and Actions (Edit, Delete, Reset Password). Each action must trigger a confirmation modal before execution. The interface must show comprehensive system statistics with interactive charts using Recharts library.</p>
    
    <h3>3.5.2 API Interface Requirements</h3>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>API-1: RESTful Architecture</strong></p>
    <p>All API endpoints shall follow RESTful conventions using appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal). URLs must follow the pattern /api/v1/{resource}/{id}/{sub-resource} for hierarchical resources. All endpoints must accept and return JSON-formatted data with Content-Type: application/json headers.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>API-2: Authentication Header</strong></p>
    <p>Protected API endpoints shall require a Bearer token in the Authorization header with format "Bearer {jwt_token}". The system must validate token signature, expiration, and user permissions before processing requests. Invalid or expired tokens must return HTTP 401 Unauthorized with error details in JSON format.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>API-3: Request Validation</strong></p>
    <p>All API requests shall validate input parameters for type correctness, required fields, format constraints, and business rules. Validation failures must return HTTP 400 Bad Request with a structured error response containing field-specific error messages. The response format must include error code, message, and failed field names.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>API-4: Response Format</strong></p>
    <p>Successful API responses shall return HTTP 200-299 status codes with a consistent JSON structure containing "success" boolean, "data" object, and optional "message" string. Error responses must include "success: false", "error" object with code and message, and HTTP 400-599 status codes based on error type. Paginated responses must include metadata for total count, page number, and page size.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>API-5: Rate Limiting Headers</strong></p>
    <p>All API responses shall include rate limiting headers: X-RateLimit-Limit (total allowed requests), X-RateLimit-Remaining (requests remaining), and X-RateLimit-Reset (timestamp for limit reset). When rate limit is exceeded, the API must return HTTP 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header indicating wait time in seconds.</p>
    
    <h3>3.5.3 DigitalOcean AI Platform Interface</h3>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>AI-1: Knowledge Base API</strong></p>
    <p>The system shall interface with DigitalOcean Knowledge Base API to create subject-specific knowledge bases, upload and index documents, and manage knowledge base lifecycle. API calls must include authentication via DigitalOcean API token in X-Auth-Token header. The system must handle asynchronous indexing operations with polling for completion status.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>AI-2: Chat Completion API</strong></p>
    <p>The system shall interface with DigitalOcean GradientAI Chat Completion API using the OpenAI-compatible format. Requests must specify model name (llama-3.3-70b-instruct), messages array with role and content, and knowledge base ID for context. The system must handle streaming responses using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time message delivery.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>AI-3: Model Configuration</strong></p>
    <p>AI API requests shall include configuration parameters: temperature (0.7 default for balanced creativity), max_tokens (4096 default), top_p (0.9 for nucleus sampling), and frequency_penalty (0.0 default). The system must respect token limits and split large requests when necessary. Response metadata must be captured including token usage, model version, and processing time.</p>
    
    <h3>3.5.4 Storage Interface Requirements</h3>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>STORAGE-1: DigitalOcean Spaces Interface</strong></p>
    <p>The system shall interface with DigitalOcean Spaces using S3-compatible API through AWS SDK for Go. Upload operations must use multipart upload for files larger than 5MB with 5MB chunk size. All objects must be stored with private ACL and accessed through pre-signed URLs with 1-hour expiration. The system must set appropriate Content-Type headers based on file extensions.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>STORAGE-2: CDN Integration</strong></p>
    <p>Uploaded documents shall be accessible through DigitalOcean Spaces CDN for improved delivery performance. The CDN must cache objects based on Cache-Control headers with maximum age of 3600 seconds for static documents. The system must support cache invalidation through API calls when documents are updated or deleted.</p>
    
    <h3>3.5.5 Communication Protocols</h3>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>PROTOCOL-1: HTTPS/TLS</strong></p>
    <p>All client-server communication shall use HTTPS protocol with TLS 1.2 or higher encryption. The system must enforce HTTPS by redirecting HTTP requests to HTTPS endpoints. SSL certificates must be valid, properly configured, and automatically renewed before expiration.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>PROTOCOL-2: WebSocket/SSE</strong></p>
    <p>Real-time features including chat streaming and progress updates shall use Server-Sent Events (SSE) over HTTP. SSE connections must maintain keep-alive with heartbeat messages every 30 seconds. The system must handle connection drops gracefully with automatic reconnection attempts using exponential backoff.</p>
    
    <p class="no-indent"><strong>PROTOCOL-3: Database Protocol</strong></p>
    <p>Database connections shall use PostgreSQL wire protocol over TCP with SSL/TLS encryption enabled. Connection pooling must use persistent connections with maximum lifetime of 1 hour. The system must implement prepared statements for all parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.</p>
