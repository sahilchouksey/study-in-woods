        <h2>1.1 About the Project</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Study in Woods</strong> is an innovative AI-powered educational platform designed to transform the way students interact with their academic materials. In today's digital age, students face significant challenges in organizing course content, understanding complex syllabi, and accessing relevant study materials efficiently. This project addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent study companion that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance the learning experience.</p>
        
        <p>The platform serves as a comprehensive academic management system that integrates modern web technologies with advanced AI capabilities to create a seamless educational ecosystem. It enables students to upload course syllabi in PDF format, which are then automatically processed using state-of-the-art natural language processing to extract structured information including course units, topics, subtopics, and learning outcomes.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, the system incorporates an intelligent chat interface powered by large language models, allowing students to engage in natural conversations about their course materials. This conversational AI has contextual awareness of uploaded documents and can provide detailed explanations, answer questions, and offer study guidance tailored to specific subjects and topics.</p>
