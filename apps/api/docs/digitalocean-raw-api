Terms of Service
Introduction
The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.

All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean control panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the complex actions that your situation requires.

The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design and technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information about specific endpoints.

Requests
Any tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by requesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods depending on the action required.

Method	Usage
GET	For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method. The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests. Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.
DELETE	To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and environment, the DELETE method should be used. This will remove the specified object if it is found. If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its existence.
PUT	To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent. It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.
PATCH	Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.
POST	To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object. When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.
HEAD	Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD method to get the headers. This returns only the header of what would be returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some useful information about your API access and the results that are available for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination information, and the total content length.
HTTP Statuses
Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.

In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the body of the response will usually contain additional information about the problem that was encountered.

In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.

Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue with the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you did not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you do not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not exist, or that your request is malformed.

If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and cannot fulfill your request currently.

400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body, including the following attributes:

Name	Type	Description
id	string	A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be "not_found."
message	string	A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.
request_id	string	Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.
Example Error Response
    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    {
      "id":       "forbidden",
      "message":  "You do not have access for the attempted action."
    }
Responses
When a request is successful, a response body will typically be sent back in the form of a JSON object. An exception to this is when a DELETE request is processed, which will result in a successful HTTP 204 status and an empty response body.

Inside of this JSON object, the resource root that was the target of the request will be set as the key. This will be the singular form of the word if the request operated on a single object, and the plural form of the word if a collection was processed.

For example, if you send a GET request to /v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID you will get back an object with a key called "droplet". However, if you send the GET request to the general collection at /v2/droplets, you will get back an object with a key called "droplets".

The value of these keys will generally be a JSON object for a request on a single object and an array of objects for a request on a collection of objects.

Response for a Single Object
    {
        "droplet": {
            "name": "example.com"
            . . .
        }
    }
Response for an Object Collection
    {
        "droplets": [
            {
                "name": "example.com"
                . . .
            },
            {
                "name": "second.com"
                . . .
            }
        ]
    }
Meta
In addition to the main resource root, the response may also contain a meta object. This object contains information about the response itself.

The meta object contains a total key that is set to the total number of objects returned by the request. This has implications on the links object and pagination.

The meta object will only be displayed when it has a value. Currently, the meta object will have a value when a request is made on a collection (like droplets or domains).

Sample Meta Object
    {
        . . .
        "meta": {
            "total": 43
        }
        . . .
    }
Links & Pagination
The links object is returned as part of the response body when pagination is enabled. By default, 20 objects are returned per page. If the response contains 20 objects or fewer, no links object will be returned. If the response contains more than 20 objects, the first 20 will be returned along with the links object.

You can request a different pagination limit or force pagination by appending ?per_page= to the request with the number of items you would like per page. For instance, to show only two results per page, you could add ?per_page=2 to the end of your query. The maximum number of results per page is 200.

The links object contains a pages object. The pages object, in turn, contains keys indicating the relationship of additional pages. The values of these are the URLs of the associated pages. The keys will be one of the following:

first: The URI of the first page of results.
prev: The URI of the previous sequential page of results.
next: The URI of the next sequential page of results.
last: The URI of the last page of results.
The pages object will only include the links that make sense. So for the first page of results, no first or prev links will ever be set. This convention holds true in other situations where a link would not make sense.

Sample Links Object
    {
        . . .
        "links": {
            "pages": {
                "last": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2",
                "next": "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?page=2"
            }
        }
        . . .
    }
Rate Limit
Requests through the API are rate limited per OAuth token. Current rate limits:

5,000 requests per hour
250 requests per minute (5% of the hourly total)
Once you exceed either limit, you will be rate limited until the next cycle starts. Space out any requests that you would otherwise issue in bursts for the best results.

The rate limiting information is contained within the response headers of each request. The relevant headers are:

ratelimit-limit: The number of requests that can be made per hour.
ratelimit-remaining: The number of requests that remain before you hit your request limit. See the information below for how the request limits expire.
ratelimit-reset: This represents the time when the oldest request will expire. The value is given in Unix epoch time. See below for more information about how request limits expire.
More rate limiting information is returned only within burst limit error response headers:

retry-after: The number of seconds to wait before making another request when rate limited.
As long as the ratelimit-remaining count is above zero, you will be able to make additional requests.

The way that a request expires and is removed from the current limit count is important to understand. Rather than counting all of the requests for an hour and resetting the ratelimit-remaining value at the end of the hour, each request instead has its own timer.

This means that each request contributes toward the ratelimit-remaining count for one complete hour after the request is made. When that request's timer runs out, it is no longer counted towards the request limit.

This has implications on the meaning of the ratelimit-reset header as well. Because the entire rate limit is not reset at one time, the value of this header is set to the time when the oldest request will expire.

Keep this in mind if you see your ratelimit-reset value change, but not move an entire hour into the future.

If the ratelimit-remaining reaches zero, subsequent requests will receive a 429 error code until the request reset has been reached.

ratelimit-remaining reaching zero can also indicate that the "burst limit" of 250 requests per minute limit was met, even if the 5,000 requests per hour limit was not. In this case, the 429 error response will include a retry-after header to indicate how long to wait (in seconds) until the request may be retried.

You can see the format of the response in the examples.

Note: The following endpoints have special rate limit requirements that are independent of the limits defined above.

Only 10 GET requests to the /v2/account/keys endpoint to list SSH keys can be made per 60 seconds.
Only 5 requests to any and all v2/cdn/endpoints can be made per 10 seconds. This includes v2/cdn/endpoints, v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID, and v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache.
Only 50 strings within the files json struct in the v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache payload can be requested every 20 seconds.
Sample Rate Limit Headers
    . . .
    ratelimit-limit: 1200
    ratelimit-remaining: 1193
    rateLimit-reset: 1402425459
    . . .
Sample Rate Limit Headers When Burst Limit is Reached:
    . . .
    ratelimit-limit: 5000
    ratelimit-remaining: 0
    rateLimit-reset: 1402425459
    retry-after: 29
    . . .
Sample Rate Exceeded Response
    429 Too Many Requests
    {
            id: "too_many_requests",
            message: "API Rate limit exceeded."
    }
Curl Examples
Throughout this document, some example API requests will be given using the curl command. This will allow us to demonstrate the various endpoints in a simple, textual format.

These examples assume that you are using a Linux or macOS command line. To run these commands on a Windows machine, you can either use cmd.exe, PowerShell, or WSL:

For cmd.exe, use the set VAR=VALUE syntax to define environment variables, call them with %VAR%, then replace all backslashes (\) in the examples with carets (^).

For PowerShell, use the $Env:VAR = "VALUE" syntax to define environment variables, call them with $Env:VAR, then replace curl with curl.exe and all backslashes (\) in the examples with backticks (`).

WSL is a compatibility layer that allows you to emulate a Linux terminal on a Windows machine. Install WSL with our community tutorial, then follow this API documentation normally.

The names of account-specific references (like Droplet IDs, for instance) will be represented by variables. For instance, a Droplet ID may be represented by a variable called $DROPLET_ID. You can set the associated variables in your environment if you wish to use the examples without modification.

The first variable that you should set to get started is your OAuth authorization token. The next section will go over the details of this, but you can set an environmental variable for it now.

Generate a token by going to the Apps & API section of the DigitalOcean control panel. Use an existing token if you have saved one, or generate a new token with the "Generate new token" button. Copy the generated token and use it to set and export the TOKEN variable in your environment as the example shows.

You may also wish to set some other variables now or as you go along. For example, you may wish to set the DROPLET_ID variable to one of your Droplet IDs since this will be used frequently in the API.

If you are following along, make sure you use a Droplet ID that you control so that your commands will execute correctly.

If you need access to the headers of a response through curl, you can pass the -i flag to display the header information along with the body. If you are only interested in the header, you can instead pass the -I flag, which will exclude the response body entirely.

Set and Export your OAuth Token
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_token_here
Set and Export a Variable
export DROPLET_ID=1111111
Parameters
There are two different ways to pass parameters in a request with the API.

When passing parameters to create or update an object, parameters should be passed as a JSON object containing the appropriate attribute names and values as key-value pairs. When you use this format, you should specify that you are sending a JSON object in the header. This is done by setting the Content-Type header to application/json. This ensures that your request is interpreted correctly.

When passing parameters to filter a response on GET requests, parameters can be passed using standard query attributes. In this case, the parameters would be embedded into the URI itself by appending a ? to the end of the URI and then setting each attribute with an equal sign. Attributes can be separated with a &. Tools like curl can create the appropriate URI when given parameters and values; this can also be done using the -F flag and then passing the key and value as an argument. The argument should take the form of a quoted string with the attribute being set to a value with an equal sign.

Pass Parameters as a JSON Object
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"name": "example.com", "ip_address": "127.0.0.1"}' \
        -X POST "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/domains"
Pass Filter Parameters as a Query String
     curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" \
         -X GET \
         "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/images?private=true"
Cross Origin Resource Sharing
In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.

CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can send requests to an outside domain.

The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions (other than GET requests) begins by sending a "preflight" request. This sets the Origin header and uses the OPTIONS method. The server will reply back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed constraints.

This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers that will be set to show the constraints are:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an Origin header.
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.
Access-Control-Max-Age: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: This will be set to true. It basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.
You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers, because the browser will typically do all of the work for you.

1-Click Applications
1-Click applications are pre-built Droplet images or Kubernetes apps with software, features, and configuration details already set up for you. They can be found in the DigitalOcean Marketplace.

List 1-Click Applications
To list all available 1-Click applications, send a GET request to /v2/1-clicks. The type may be provided as query paramater in order to restrict results to a certain type of 1-Click, for example: /v2/1-clicks?type=droplet. Current supported types are kubernetes and droplet.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called 1_clicks. This will be set to an array of 1-Click application data, each of which will contain the the slug and type for the 1-Click.

Actions
Actions are records of events that have occurred on the resources in your account. These can be things like rebooting a Droplet, or transferring an image to a new region.

An action object is created every time one of these actions is initiated. The action object contains information about the current status of the action, start and complete timestamps, and the associated resource type and ID.

Every action that creates an action object is available through this endpoint. Completed actions are not removed from this list and are always available for querying.

Note: You can pass the following HTTP header with the request to have the API return the reserved_ips stanza instead of the floating_ips stanza:

Accept: application/vnd.digitalocean.reserveip+json

Billing
The billing endpoints allow you to retrieve your account balance, invoices and billing history.

Balance: By sending requests to the /v2/customers/my/balance endpoint, you can retrieve the balance information for the requested customer account.

Invoices: Invoices are generated on the first of each month for every DigitalOcean customer. An invoice preview is generated daily, which can be accessed with the preview keyword in place of $INVOICE_UUID. To interact with invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at /v2/customers/my/invoices.

Billing History: Billing history is a record of billing events for your account. For example, entries may include events like payments made, invoices issued, or credits granted. To interact with invoices, you will generally send requests to the invoices endpoint at /v2/customers/my/billing_history.

Block Storage
DigitalOcean Block Storage Volumes provide expanded storage capacity for your Droplets and can be moved between Droplets within a specific region.

Volumes function as raw block devices, meaning they appear to the operating system as locally attached storage which can be formatted using any file system supported by the OS. They may be created in sizes from 1GiB to 16TiB.

By sending requests to the /v2/volumes endpoint, you can list, create, or delete volumes as well as attach and detach them from Droplets

List All Block Storage Volumes
To list all of the block storage volumes available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/volumes.

Filtering Results
By Region
The region may be provided as query parameter in order to restrict results to volumes available in a specific region. For example: /v2/volumes?region=nyc1

By Name
It is also possible to list volumes on your account that match a specified name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name as a query parameter to /v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME. Note: You can only create one volume per region with the same name.

By Name and Region
It is also possible to retrieve information about a block storage volume by name. To do so, send a GET request with the volume's name and the region slug for the region it is located in as query parameters to /v2/volumes?name=$VOLUME_NAME&region=nyc1.

Authorizations:

Block Storage Actions
Block storage actions are commands that can be given to a DigitalOcean Block Storage Volume. An example would be detaching or attaching a volume from a Droplet. These requests are made on the /v2/volumes/$VOLUME_ID/actions endpoint.

An action object is returned. These objects hold the current status of the requested action.

Initiate A Block Storage Action By Volume Name
To initiate an action on a block storage volume by Name, send a POST request to ~/v2/volumes/actions. The body should contain the appropriate attributes for the respective action.

Purge the Cache for an Existing CDN Endpoint
To purge cached content from a CDN endpoint, send a DELETE request to /v2/cdn/endpoints/$ENDPOINT_ID/cache. The body of the request should include a files attribute containing a list of cached file paths to be purged. A path may be for a single file or may contain a wildcard (*) to recursively purge all files under a directory. When only a wildcard is provided, all cached files will be purged. There is a rate limit of 50 files per 20 seconds that can be purged. CDN endpoints have a rate limit of 5 requests per 10 seconds. Purging files using a wildcard path counts as a single request against the API's rate limit. Two identical purge requests cannot be sent at the same time.

Certificates
In order to perform SSL termination on load balancers, DigitalOcean offers two types of SSL certificate management:

Custom: User-generated certificates may be uploaded to DigitalOcean where they will be placed in a fully encrypted and isolated storage system.

Let's Encrypt: Certificates may be automatically generated by DigitalOcean utilizing an integration with Let's Encrypt, the free and open certificate authority. These certificates will also be automatically renewed as required.

List All Certificates
To list all of the certificates available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/certificates.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
query Parameters
per_page
integer [ 1 .. 200 ]
Default: 20
Example: per_page=2
Number of items returned per page

page
integer >= 1
Default: 1
Example: page=1
Which 'page' of paginated results to return.

name
string
Default: ""
Example: name=certificate-name
Name of expected certificate

Container Registry
DigitalOcean offers the ability for you to create a private container registry to store your Docker images for use with your Kubernetes clusters. This container registry runs inside the same datacenters as your cluster, ensuring reliable and performant rollout of image deployments.

You can only create one registry per DigitalOcean account, but you can use that registry to create as many repositories as you wish.

Get Container Registry Information
To get information about your container registry, send a GET request to /v2/registry. This operation is not compatible with multiple registries in a DO account. You should use /v2/registries/{registry_name} instead.

Get Docker Credentials for Container Registry
In order to access your container registry with the Docker client or from a Kubernetes cluster, you will need to configure authentication. The necessary JSON configuration can be retrieved by sending a GET request to /v2/registry/docker-credentials.

The response will be in the format of a Docker config.json file. To use the config in your Kubernetes cluster, create a Secret with:

kubectl create secret generic docr \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=config.json \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
By default, the returned credentials have read-only access to your registry and cannot be used to push images. This is appropriate for most Kubernetes clusters. To retrieve read/write credentials, suitable for use with the Docker client or in a CI system, read_write may be provided as query parameter. For example: /v2/registry/docker-credentials?read_write=true

By default, the returned credentials will not expire. To retrieve credentials with an expiry set, expiry_seconds may be provided as a query parameter. For example: /v2/registry/docker-credentials?expiry_seconds=3600 will return credentials that expire after one hour.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
query Parameters
expiry_seconds
integer >= 0
Default: 0
Example: expiry_seconds=3600
The duration in seconds that the returned registry credentials will be valid. If not set or 0, the credentials will not expire.

read_write
boolean
Default: false
Example: read_write=true
By default, the registry credentials allow for read-only access. Set this query parameter to true to obtain read-write credentials.

Responses

To delete a container repository manifest by digest, send a DELETE request to /v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/repositories/$REPOSITORY_NAME/digests/$MANIFEST_DIGEST.

Note that if your repository name contains / characters, it must be URL-encoded in the request URL. For example, to delete registry.digitalocean.com/example/my/repo@sha256:abcd, the path would be /v2/registry/example/repositories/my%2Frepo/digests/sha256:abcd.

A successful request will receive a 204 status code with no body in response. This indicates that the request was processed successfully.

Start Garbage Collection
Garbage collection enables users to clear out unreferenced blobs (layer & manifest data) after deleting one or more manifests from a repository. If there are no unreferenced blobs resulting from the deletion of one or more manifests, garbage collection is effectively a noop. See here for more information about how and why you should clean up your container registry periodically.

To request a garbage collection run on your registry, send a POST request to /v2/registry/$REGISTRY_NAME/garbage-collection. This will initiate the following sequence of events on your registry.

Set the registry to read-only mode, meaning no further write-scoped JWTs will be issued to registry clients. Existing write-scoped JWTs will continue to work until they expire which can take up to 15 minutes.
Wait until all existing write-scoped JWTs have expired.
Scan all registry manifests to determine which blobs are unreferenced.
Delete all unreferenced blobs from the registry.
Record the number of blobs deleted and bytes freed, mark the garbage collection status as success.
Remove the read-only mode restriction from the registry, meaning write-scoped JWTs will once again be issued to registry clients.

Container Registries
DigitalOcean now supports up to nine additional registries (for a total maximum of 10) per team if your container registry uses the Professional subscription plan. The storage is shared among the registries. This set of new APIs is backward compatible with /v2/registry. However, if you create more than one registry under a Professional plan, some of the /v2/registry APIs would not work. Hence, it is recommended to use /v2/registries for multiple registries. Currently, these APIs are in Public Preview.

[Public Preview] Get Docker Credentials By Registry Name
In order to access your container registry with the Docker client or from a Kubernetes cluster, you will need to configure authentication. The necessary JSON configuration can be retrieved by sending a GET request to /v2/registries/{registry_name}/docker-credentials.

The response will be in the format of a Docker config.json file. To use the config in your Kubernetes cluster, create a Secret with:

kubectl create secret generic docr \
  --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=config.json \
  --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
By default, the returned credentials have read-only access to your registry and cannot be used to push images. This is appropriate for most Kubernetes clusters. To retrieve read/write credentials, suitable for use with the Docker client or in a CI system, read_write may be provided as query parameter. For example: /v2/registries/{registry_name}/docker-credentials?read_write=true

By default, the returned credentials will not expire. To retrieve credentials with an expiry set, expiry_seconds may be provided as a query parameter. For example: /v2/registries/{registry_name}/docker-credentials?expiry_seconds=3600 will return credentials that expire after one hour.

Databases
DigitalOcean's managed database service simplifies the creation and management of highly available database clusters. Currently, it offers support for PostgreSQL, Caching, Valkey, MySQL, MongoDB, and OpenSearch.

By sending requests to the /v2/databases endpoint, you can list, create, or delete database clusters as well as scale the size of a cluster, add or remove read-only replicas, and manage other configuration details.

Database clusters may be deployed in a multi-node, high-availability configuration. If your machine type is above the basic nodes, your node plan is above the smallest option, or you are running MongoDB, you may additionally include up to two standby nodes in your cluster.

The size of individual nodes in a database cluster is represented by a human-readable slug, which is used in some of the following requests. Each slug denotes the node's identifier, CPU count, and amount of RAM, in that order.

For a list of currently available database slugs and options, use the /v2/databases/options endpoint or use the doctl databases options command.

List Database Options
To list all of the options available for the offered database engines, send a GET request to /v2/databases/options. The result will be a JSON object with an options key.

Authorizations:

List All Database Clusters
To list all of the database clusters available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/databases. To limit the results to database clusters with a specific tag, include the tag_name query parameter set to the name of the tag. For example, /v2/databases?tag_name=$TAG_NAME.

The result will be a JSON object with a databases key. This will be set to an array of database objects, each of which will contain the standard database attributes.

The embedded connection and private_connection objects will contain the information needed to access the database cluster. For multi-node clusters, the standby_connection and standby_private_connection objects will contain the information needed to connect to the cluster's standby node(s).

The embedded maintenance_window object will contain information about any scheduled maintenance for the database cluster.

Create a New Database Cluster
To create a database cluster, send a POST request to /v2/databases. To see a list of options for each engine, such as available regions, size slugs, and versions, send a GET request to the /v2/databases/options endpoint. The available sizes for the storage_size_mib field depends on the cluster's size. To see a list of available sizes, see Managed Database Pricing.

The create response returns a JSON object with a key called database. The value of this is an object that contains the standard attributes associated with a database cluster. The initial value of the database cluster's status attribute is creating. When the cluster is ready to receive traffic, this changes to online.

The embedded connection and private_connection objects contains the information needed to access the database cluster. For multi-node clusters, the standby_connection and standby_private_connection objects contain the information needed to connect to the cluster's standby node(s).

DigitalOcean managed PostgreSQL and MySQL database clusters take automated daily backups. To create a new database cluster based on a backup of an existing cluster, send a POST request to /v2/databases. In addition to the standard database cluster attributes, the JSON body must include a key named backup_restore with the name of the original database cluster and the timestamp of the backup to be restored. Creating a database from a backup is the same as forking a database in the control panel. Note: Caching cluster creates are no longer supported as of 2025-04-30T00:00:00Z. Backups are also not supported for Caching or Valkey clusters.

Add a New Connection Pool (PostgreSQL)
For PostgreSQL database clusters, connection pools can be used to allow a database to share its idle connections. The popular PostgreSQL connection pooling utility PgBouncer is used to provide this service. See here for more information about how and why to use PgBouncer connection pooling including details about the available transaction modes.

To add a new connection pool to a PostgreSQL database cluster, send a POST request to /v2/databases/$DATABASE_ID/pools specifying a name for the pool, the user to connect with, the database to connect to, as well as its desired size and transaction mode.

mode
required
string
The PGBouncer transaction mode for the connection pool. The allowed values are session, transaction, and statement.

size
required
integer <int32>
The desired size of the PGBouncer connection pool. The maximum allowed size is determined by the size of the cluster's primary node. 25 backend server connections are allowed for every 1GB of RAM. Three are reserved for maintenance. For example, a primary node with 1 GB of RAM allows for a maximum of 22 backend server connections while one with 4 GB would allow for 97. Note that these are shared across all connection pools in a cluster.

db
required
string
The database for use with the connection pool.

user

Domain Records
Domain record resources are used to set or retrieve information about the individual DNS records configured for a domain. This allows you to build and manage DNS zone files by adding and modifying individual records for a domain.

The DigitalOcean DNS management interface allows you to configure the following DNS records:

Name	Description
A	This record type is used to map an IPv4 address to a hostname.
AAAA	This record type is used to map an IPv6 address to a hostname.
CAA	As specified in RFC-6844, this record type can be used to restrict which certificate authorities are permitted to issue certificates for a domain.
CNAME	This record type defines an alias for your canonical hostname (the one defined by an A or AAAA record).
MX	This record type is used to define the mail exchanges used for the domain.
NS	This record type defines the name servers that are used for this zone.
TXT	This record type is used to associate a string of text with a hostname, primarily used for verification.
SRV	This record type specifies the location (hostname and port number) of servers for specific services.
SOA	This record type defines administrative information about the zone. Can only have ttl changed, cannot be deleted
List All Domain Records
To get a listing of all records configured for a domain, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records. The list of records returned can be filtered by using the name and type query parameters. For example, to only include A records for a domain, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?type=A. name must be a fully qualified record name. For example, to only include records matching sub.example.com, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?name=sub.example.com. Both name and type may be used together.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
path Parameters
domain_name
required
string
Example: example.com
The name of the domain itself.

query Parameters
name
string
Example: name=sub.example.com
A fully qualified record name. For example, to only include records matching sub.example.com, send a GET request to /v2/domains/$DOMAIN_NAME/records?name=sub.example.com.

type
string
Enum: "A" "AAAA" "CAA" "CNAME" "MX" "NS" "SOA" "SRV" "TXT"
Example: type=A
The type of the DNS record. For example: A, CNAME, TXT, ...

per_page
integer [ 1 .. 200 ]
Default: 20
Example: per_page=2
Number of items returned per page

page
integer >= 1
Default: 1
Example: page=1
Which 'page' of paginated results to return.

Responses
200 The response will be a JSON object with a key called domain_records. The value of this will be an array of domain record objects, each of which contains the standard domain record attributes. For attributes that are not used by a specific record type, a value of null will be returned. For instance, all records other than SRV will have null for the weight and port attributes.

Droplet Actions
Droplet actions are tasks that can be executed on a Droplet. These can be things like rebooting, resizing, snapshotting, etc.

Droplet action requests are generally targeted at one of the "actions" endpoints for a specific Droplet. The specific actions are usually initiated by sending a POST request with the action and arguments as parameters.

Droplet action requests create a Droplet actions object, which can be used to get information about the status of an action. Creating a Droplet action is asynchronous: the HTTP call will return the action object before the action has finished processing on the Droplet. The current status of an action can be retrieved from either the Droplet actions endpoint or the global actions endpoint. If a Droplet action is uncompleted it may block the creation of a subsequent action for that Droplet, the locked attribute of the Droplet will be true and attempts to create a Droplet action will fail with a status of 422.

List Actions for a Droplet
To retrieve a list of all actions that have been executed for a Droplet, send a GET request to /v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/actions.

The results will be returned as a JSON object with an actions key. This will be set to an array filled with action objects containing the standard action attributes.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
path Parameters
droplet_id
required
integer >= 1
Example: 3164444
A unique identifier for a Droplet instance.

query Parameters

Initiate a Droplet Action
To initiate an action on a Droplet send a POST request to /v2/droplets/$DROPLET_ID/actions. In the JSON body to the request, set the type attribute to on of the supported action types:

Action	Details	Additionally Required Permission
enable_backups	Enables backups for a Droplet
disable_backups	Disables backups for a Droplet
change_backup_policy	Update the backup policy for a Droplet
reboot	Reboots a Droplet. A reboot action is an attempt to reboot the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the reboot command from the console.
power_cycle	Power cycles a Droplet. A powercycle action is similar to pushing the reset button on a physical machine, it's similar to booting from scratch.
shutdown	Shutsdown a Droplet. A shutdown action is an attempt to shutdown the Droplet in a graceful way, similar to using the shutdown command from the console. Since a shutdown command can fail, this action guarantees that the command is issued, not that it succeeds. The preferred way to turn off a Droplet is to attempt a shutdown, with a reasonable timeout, followed by a power_off action to ensure the Droplet is off.
power_off	Powers off a Droplet. A power_off event is a hard shutdown and should only be used if the shutdown action is not successful. It is similar to cutting the power on a server and could lead to complications.
power_on	Powers on a Droplet.
restore	Restore a Droplet using a backup image. The image ID that is passed in must be a backup of the current Droplet instance. The operation will leave any embedded SSH keys intact.	droplet:admin
password_reset	Resets the root password for a Droplet. A new password will be provided via email. It must be changed after first use.	droplet:admin
resize	Resizes a Droplet. Set the size attribute to a size slug. If a permanent resize with disk changes included is desired, set the disk attribute to true.	droplet:create
rebuild	Rebuilds a Droplet from a new base image. Set the image attribute to an image ID or slug.	droplet:admin
rename	Renames a Droplet.
change_kernel	Changes a Droplet's kernel. Only applies to Droplets with externally managed kernels. All Droplets created after March 2017 use internal kernels by default.
enable_ipv6	Enables IPv6 for a Droplet. Once enabled for a Droplet, IPv6 can not be disabled. When enabling IPv6 on an existing Droplet, additional OS-level configuration is required.
snapshot	Takes a snapshot of a Droplet.	image:create

Droplets
A Droplet is a DigitalOcean virtual machine. By sending requests to the Droplet endpoint, you can list, create, or delete Droplets.

Some of the attributes will have an object value. The region and image objects will all contain the standard attributes of their associated types. Find more information about each of these objects in their respective sections.

List All Droplets
To list all Droplets in your account, send a GET request to /v2/droplets.

The response body will be a JSON object with a key of droplets. This will be set to an array containing objects each representing a Droplet. These will contain the standard Droplet attributes.

Filtering Results by Tag
It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters. To only list Droplets assigned to a specific tag, include the tag_name query parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example, /v2/droplets?tag_name=$TAG_NAME.

GPU Droplets
By default, only non-GPU Droplets are returned. To list only GPU Droplets, set the type query parameter to gpus. For example, /v2/droplets?type=gpus.

Authorizations:

Create a New Droplet
To create a new Droplet, send a POST request to /v2/droplets setting the required attributes.

A Droplet will be created using the provided information. The response body will contain a JSON object with a key called droplet. The value will be an object containing the standard attributes for your new Droplet. The response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of the operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The actions returned as part of the response's links object can be used to check the status of the Droplet create event.

Create Multiple Droplets
Creating multiple Droplets is very similar to creating a single Droplet. Instead of sending name as a string, send names as an array of strings. A Droplet will be created for each name you send using the associated information. Up to ten Droplets may be created this way at a time.

Rather than returning a single Droplet, the response body will contain a JSON array with a key called droplets. This will be set to an array of JSON objects, each of which will contain the standard Droplet attributes. The response code, 202 Accepted, does not indicate the success or failure of any operation, just that the request has been accepted for processing. The array of actions returned as part of the response's links object can be used to check the status of each individual Droplet create event.

boolean
Default: false
A boolean indicating whether to install the DigitalOcean agent for monitoring.

tags
Array of strings or null
Default: []
A flat array of tag names as strings to apply to the Droplet after it is created. Tag names can either be existing or new tags.
Requires tag:create scope.

user_data
string
A string containing 'user data' which may be used to configure the Droplet on first boot, often a 'cloud-config' file or Bash script. It must be plain text and may not exceed 64 KiB in size.

private_networking
boolean
Deprecated
Default: false
This parameter has been deprecated. Use vpc_uuid instead to specify a VPC network for the Droplet. If no vpc_uuid is provided, the Droplet will be placed in your account's default VPC for the region.

volumes
Array of strings
Default: []
An array of IDs for block storage volumes that will be attached to the Droplet once created. The volumes must not already be attached to an existing Droplet.
Requires block_storage:read scpoe.

vpc_uuid
string
A string specifying the UUID of the VPC to which the Droplet will be assigned. If excluded, the Droplet will be assigned to your account's default VPC for the region.
Requires vpc:read scope.

with_droplet_agent
boolean
A boolean indicating whether to install the DigitalOcean agent used for providing access to the Droplet web console in the control panel. By default, the agent is installed on new Droplets but installation errors (i.e. OS not supported) are ignored. To prevent it from being installed, set to false. To make installation errors fatal, explicitly set it to true.

List All Droplet Neighbors
To retrieve a list of all Droplets that are co-located on the same physical hardware, send a GET request to /v2/reports/droplet_neighbors_ids.

The results will be returned as a JSON object with a key of neighbor_ids. This will be set to an array of arrays. Each array will contain a set of Droplet IDs for Droplets that share a physical server. An empty array indicates that all Droplets associated with your account are located on separate physical hardware.

Floating IP Actions
As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields. For example, the floating_ips field is now the reserved_ips field. The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the Projects API, we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API where the floating_ip field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response will contain the field reserved_ips in addition to the floating_ips field. Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

Floating IP actions are commands that can be given to a DigitalOcean floating IP. These requests are made on the actions endpoint of a specific floating IP.

An action object is returned. These objects hold the current status of the requested action.

Images
A DigitalOcean image can be used to create a Droplet and may come in a number of flavors. Currently, there are five types of images: snapshots, backups, applications, distributions, and custom images.

Snapshots provide a full copy of an existing Droplet instance taken on demand.

Backups are similar to snapshots but are created automatically at regular intervals when enabled for a Droplet.

Custom images are Linux-based virtual machine images (raw, qcow2, vhdx, vdi, and vmdk formats are supported) that you may upload for use on DigitalOcean.

Distributions are the public Linux distributions that are available to be used as a base to create Droplets.

Applications, or 1-Click Apps, are distributions pre-configured with additional software.

To interact with images, you will generally send requests to the images endpoint at /v2/images.

List All Images
To list all of the images available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/images.

Filtering Results
It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.

Image Type

Either 1-Click Application or OS Distribution images can be filtered by using the type query parameter.

Important: The type query parameter does not directly relate to the type attribute.

To retrieve only distribution images, include the type query parameter set to distribution, /v2/images?type=distribution.

To retrieve only application images, include the type query parameter set to application, /v2/images?type=application.

User Images

To retrieve only the private images of a user, include the private query parameter set to true, /v2/images?private=true.

Tags

To list all images assigned to a specific tag, include the tag_name query parameter set to the name of the tag in your GET request. For example, /v2/images?tag_name=$TAG_NAME.

Selectively Delete a Cluster and its Associated Resources
To delete a Kubernetes cluster along with a subset of its associated resources, send a DELETE request to /v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/destroy_with_associated_resources/selective.

The JSON body of the request should include load_balancers, volumes, or volume_snapshots keys each set to an array of IDs for the associated resources to be destroyed.

The IDs can be found by querying the cluster's associated resources endpoint. Any associated resource not included in the request will remain and continue to accrue changes on your account.

Retrieve the kubeconfig for a Kubernetes Cluster
This endpoint returns a kubeconfig file in YAML format. It can be used to connect to and administer the cluster using the Kubernetes command line tool, kubectl, or other programs supporting kubeconfig files (e.g., client libraries).

The resulting kubeconfig file uses token-based authentication for clusters supporting it, and certificate-based authentication otherwise. For a list of supported versions and more information, see "How to Connect to a DigitalOcean Kubernetes Cluster".

To retrieve a kubeconfig file for use with a Kubernetes cluster, send a GET request to /v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig.

Clusters supporting token-based authentication may define an expiration by passing a duration in seconds as a query parameter to /v2/kubernetes/clusters/$K8S_CLUSTER_ID/kubeconfig?expiry_seconds=$DURATION_IN_SECONDS. If not set or 0, then the token will have a 7 day expiry. The query parameter has no impact in certificate-based authentication.

Kubernetes Roles granted to a user with a token-based kubeconfig are derived from that user's DigitalOcean role. Predefined roles (Owner, Member, Modifier etc.) have an automatic mapping to Kubernetes roles. Custom roles are not automatically mapped to any Kubernetes roles, and require additional configuration by a cluster administrator.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
path Parameters
cluster_id
required
string <uuid> >= 1
Example: bd5f5959-5e1e-4205-a714-a914373942af

query Parameters
expiry_seconds
integer >= 0
Default: 0
Example: expiry_seconds=300
The duration in seconds that the returned Kubernetes credentials will be valid. If not set or 0, the credentials will have a 7 day expiry.

Responses
200 A kubeconfig file for the cluster in YAML format.
401 Authentication failed due to invalid credentials.
404 The resource was not found.

An array of taints to apply to all nodes in a pool. Taints will automatically be applied to all existing nodes and any subsequent nodes added to the pool. When a taint is removed, it is deleted from all nodes in the pool.

auto_scale
boolean
A boolean value indicating whether auto-scaling is enabled for this node pool.

min_nodes
integer
The minimum number of nodes that this node pool can be auto-scaled to. The value will be 0 if auto_scale is set to false.

max_nodes
integer
The maximum number of nodes that this node pool can be auto-scaled to. The value will be 0 if auto_scale is set to false.

Responses
202 The response will be a JSON object with a key called node_pool. The value of this will be an object containing the standard attributes of a node pool.
401 Authentication failed due to invalid credentials.
404 The resource was not found.
429 The API rate limit has been exceeded.

Load Balancers
DigitalOcean Load Balancers provide a way to distribute traffic across multiple Droplets. By sending requests to the /v2/load_balancers endpoint, you can list, create, or delete load balancers as well as add or remove Droplets, forwarding rules, and other configuration details.

Create a New Load Balancer
To create a new load balancer instance, send a POST request to /v2/load_balancers.

You can specify the Droplets that will sit behind the load balancer using one of two methods:

Set droplet_ids to a list of specific Droplet IDs.
Set tag to the name of a tag. All Droplets with this tag applied will be assigned to the load balancer. Additional Droplets will be automatically assigned as they are tagged.
These methods are mutually exclusive.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
Request Body schema: application/json
required
One of Assign Droplets by IDAssign Droplets by Tag
droplet_ids
required
Array of integers
An array containing the IDs of the Droplets assigned to the load balancer.

region
required
string (region_slug)
Enum: "ams1" "ams2" "ams3" "blr1" "fra1" "lon1" "nyc1" "nyc2" "nyc3" "sfo1" "sfo2" "sfo3" "sgp1" "tor1" "syd1"
The slug identifier for the region where the resource will initially be available.

name
string
A human-readable name for a load balancer instance.

project_id
string
The ID of the project that the load balancer is associated with. If no ID is provided at creation, the load balancer associates with the user's default project. If an invalid project ID is provided, the load balancer will not be created.

size_unit
integer [ 1 .. 100 ]
Default: 1
How many nodes the load balancer contains. Each additional node increases the load balancer's ability to manage more connections. Load balancers can be scaled up or down, and you can change the number of nodes after creation up to once per hour. This field is currently not available in the AMS2, NYC2, or SFO1 regions. Use the size field to scale load balancers that reside in these regions.

size
string
Deprecated
Default: "lb-small"
Enum: "lb-small" "lb-medium" "lb-large"
This field has been replaced by the size_unit field for all regions except in AMS2, NYC2, and SFO1. Each available load balancer size now equates to the load balancer having a set number of nodes.

lb-small = 1 node
lb-medium = 3 nodes
lb-large = 6 nodes
You can resize load balancers after creation up to once per hour. You cannot resize a load balancer within the first hour of its creation.

algorithm
string
Deprecated
Default: "round_robin"
Enum: "round_robin" "least_connections"
This field has been deprecated. You can no longer specify an algorithm for load balancers.

forwarding_rules
required
Array of objects (forwarding_rule) non-empty
An array of objects specifying the forwarding rules for a load balancer.

health_check
object (health_check)
An object specifying health check settings for the load balancer.

sticky_sessions
object (sticky_sessions)
An object specifying sticky sessions settings for the load balancer.

redirect_http_to_https
boolean
Default: false
A boolean value indicating whether HTTP requests to the load balancer on port 80 will be redirected to HTTPS on port 443.

enable_proxy_protocol
boolean
Default: false
A boolean value indicating whether PROXY Protocol is in use.

enable_backend_keepalive
boolean
Default: false
A boolean value indicating whether HTTP keepalive connections are maintained to target Droplets.

http_idle_timeout_seconds
integer [ 30 .. 600 ]
Default: 60
An integer value which configures the idle timeout for HTTP requests to the target droplets.

vpc_uuid
string <uuid>
A string specifying the UUID of the VPC to which the load balancer is assigned.

disable_lets_encrypt_dns_records
boolean
Default: false
A boolean value indicating whether to disable automatic DNS record creation for Let's Encrypt certificates that are added to the load balancer.

firewall
object (lb_firewall)
An object specifying allow and deny rules to control traffic to the load balancer.

network
string
Default: "EXTERNAL"
Enum: "EXTERNAL" "INTERNAL"
A string indicating whether the load balancer should be external or internal. Internal load balancers have no public IPs and are only accessible to resources on the same VPC network. This property cannot be updated after creating the load balancer.

network_stack
string
Default: "IPV4"
Enum: "IPV4" "DUALSTACK"
A string indicating whether the load balancer will support IPv4 or both IPv4 and IPv6 networking. This property cannot be updated after creating the load balancer.

type
string
Default: "REGIONAL"
Enum: "REGIONAL" "REGIONAL_NETWORK" "GLOBAL"
A string indicating whether the load balancer should be a standard regional HTTP load balancer, a regional network load balancer that routes traffic at the TCP/UDP transport layer, or a global load balancer.

Project Resources
Project Resources are resources that can be grouped into your projects. You can group resources (like Droplets, Spaces, load balancers, domains, and floating IPs) in ways that align with the applications you host on DigitalOcean.

Supported Resource Types Examples
Projects resources are identified by uniform resource names or URNs. A valid URN has the following format: do:resource_type:resource_id. The following resource types are supported:

Resource Type	Example URN
App Platform App	do:app:be5aab85-851b-4cab-b2ed-98d5a63ba4e8
Database	do:dbaas:83c7a55f-0d84-4760-9245-aba076ec2fb2
Domain	do:domain:example.com
Droplet	do:droplet:4126873
Floating IP	do:floatingip:192.168.99.100
Kubernetes Cluster	do:kubernetes:bd5f5959-5e1e-4205-a714-a914373942af
Load Balancer	do:loadbalancer:39052d89-8dd4-4d49-8d5a-3c3b6b365b5b
Space	do:space:my-website-assets
Volume	do:volume:6fc4c277-ea5c-448a-93cd-dd496cfef71f
Resource Status Codes
When assigning and retrieving resources in projects, a status attribute is returned that indicates if a resource was successfully retrieved or assigned. The status codes can be one of the following:

Status Code	Explanation
ok	There was no problem retrieving or assigning a resource.
not_found	The resource was not found.
assigned	The resource was successfully assigned.
already_assigned	The resource was already assigned.
service_down	There was a problem retrieving or assigning a resource. Please try again.

Delete an Existing Project
To delete a project, send a DELETE request to /v2/projects/$PROJECT_ID. To be deleted, a project must not have any resources assigned to it. Any existing resources must first be reassigned or destroyed, or you will receive a 412 error.

A successful request will receive a 204 status code with no body in response. This indicates that the request was processed successfully.

Reserved IP Actions
As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the Floating IP product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the URLs and fields. For example, the floating_ips field is now the reserved_ips field. The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the Projects API, we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API where the floating_ip field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response will contain the field reserved_ips in addition to the floating_ips field. Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

Reserved IP actions are commands that can be given to a DigitalOcean reserved IP. These requests are made on the actions endpoint of a specific reserved IP.

An action object is returned. These objects hold the current status of the requested action.

Sizes
The sizes objects represent different packages of hardware resources that can be used for Droplets. When a Droplet is created, a size must be selected so that the correct resources can be allocated.

Each size represents a plan that bundles together specific sets of resources. This includes the amount of RAM, the number of virtual CPUs, disk space, and transfer. The size object also includes the pricing details and the regions that the size is available in.

List All Droplet Sizes
To list all of available Droplet sizes, send a GET request to /v2/sizes. The response will be a JSON object with a key called sizes. The value of this will be an array of size objects each of which contain the standard size attributes.

Authorizations:

Snapshots
Snapshots are saved instances of a Droplet or a block storage volume, which is reflected in the resource_type attribute. In order to avoid problems with compressing filesystems, each defines a min_disk_size attribute which is the minimum size of the Droplet or volume disk when creating a new resource from the saved snapshot.

To interact with snapshots, you will generally send requests to the snapshots endpoint at /v2/snapshots.

List All Snapshots
To list all of the snapshots available on your account, send a GET request to /v2/snapshots.

The response will be a JSON object with a key called snapshots. This will be set to an array of snapshot objects, each of which will contain the standard snapshot attributes.

Filtering Results by Resource Type
It's possible to request filtered results by including certain query parameters.

List Droplet Snapshots
To retrieve only snapshots based on Droplets, include the resource_type query parameter set to droplet. For example, /v2/snapshots?resource_type=droplet.

List Volume Snapshots
To retrieve only snapshots based on volumes, include the resource_type query parameter set to volume. For example, /v2/snapshots?resource_type=volume.

Authorizations:

Tags
A tag is a label that can be applied to a resource (currently Droplets, Images, Volumes, Volume Snapshots, and Database clusters) in order to better organize or facilitate the lookups and actions on it.

Tags have two attributes: a user defined name attribute and an embedded resources attribute with information about resources that have been tagged.

List All Tags
To list all of your tags, you can send a GET request to /v2/tags.

This endpoint will only return tagged resources that you are authorized to see (e.g. Droplets will only be returned if you have droplet:read).

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
query Parameters
per_page
integer [ 1 .. 200 ]
Default: 20
Example: per_page=2
Number of items returned per page

page
integer >= 1
Default: 1
Example: page=1
Which 'page' of paginated results to return.

Responses
200 To list all of your tags, you can send a GET request to /v2/tags.

Create a New Tag
To create a tag you can send a POST request to /v2/tags with a name attribute.

Authorizations:
bearer_auth
Request Body schema: application/json
required
name
string <= 255 characters ^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-\:]+$
The name of the tag. Tags may contain letters, numbers, colons, dashes, and underscores. There is a limit of 255 characters per tag.

Note: Tag names are case stable, which means the capitalization you use when you first create a tag is canonical.

When working with tags in the API, you must use the tag's canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", the URL to add that tag to a resource would be https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/tags/PROD/resources (not /v2/tags/prod/resources).

Tagged resources in the control panel will always display the canonical capitalization. For example, if you create a tag named "PROD", you can tag resources in the control panel by entering "prod". The tag will still display with its canonical capitalization, "PROD".

Responses
201 The response will be a JSON object with a key called tag. The value of this will be a tag object containing the standard tag attributes
