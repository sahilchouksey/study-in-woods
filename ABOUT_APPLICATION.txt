STUDY IN WOODS - AI-Powered Study Companion Platform

Study in Woods is an intelligent web application designed to help university students organize their academic materials and enhance their learning experience through artificial intelligence. The platform addresses a common challenge faced by students - managing scattered syllabus documents, previous year question papers, and study materials across multiple subjects and semesters. By leveraging modern AI technology, specifically the Llama 3.3 70B large language model, the application can automatically read and understand PDF documents, extracting structured information such as units, topics, teaching hours, and recommended textbooks from syllabus files, as well as questions with their marks and sections from examination papers.

The application follows a hierarchical organization structure of University, Course, Semester, and Subject, making it easy for students to navigate and find their materials. When a student uploads a syllabus PDF, the system processes it through an AI extraction pipeline that runs in real-time, showing progress updates as the document is analyzed. The extracted content is then stored in a searchable database and indexed in a knowledge base, enabling the AI chat assistant to provide context-aware answers to student queries. For example, a student can ask "What topics are covered in Unit 3?" or "Explain the concept of normalization from my database syllabus" and receive accurate responses based on their actual course materials.

A powerful feature of the platform is its ability to combine local knowledge with real-time web search for enhanced responses. The system maintains a comprehensive knowledge base per subject containing indexed syllabus content, previous year questions, and student-uploaded notes. When a student queries the AI assistant, it first searches this local context, then optionally performs web searches to fetch the latest information and research. Students can enable this capability by adding their own API keys for web search services - Exa, Tavily, and Firecrawl - through the settings page. This hybrid approach allows the AI to provide answers that are both grounded in the student's actual course materials and enriched with current information from the web, resulting in more accurate and comprehensive responses to academic queries.

The technical architecture demonstrates modern software engineering practices with a Go-based backend using the Fiber framework for high-performance API handling, a Next.js 15 frontend with React 19 for a responsive user interface, PostgreSQL for reliable data storage, and Redis for caching and real-time job tracking. The application integrates with DigitalOcean's cloud services for file storage and AI inference, making it a production-ready solution that can scale to serve multiple universities and thousands of students. Security features include JWT-based authentication, bcrypt password hashing, brute force protection, and comprehensive input validation, ensuring that student data remains protected.
